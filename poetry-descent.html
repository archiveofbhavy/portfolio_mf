      <div class="poem-body">
        <p>Imagine. Like I just completed a concert.</p>
        <p>On my way down behind the curtains.</p>
        <p>Noone can see ne.</p>
        <p>I get sudden heart pain.</p>
        <p>My heart is failing.</p>
        <p>I clutch my chest.</p>
        <p>I don't want to call for help.</p>
        <p>I just think.</p>
        <p>Ig this is it god?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I take support of a wall.</p>
        <p>Then get down on my knees.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>All I can hear are the screams of the audiance.</p>
        <p>Saying how great I was.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>On the floor.</p>
        <p>I get peak satisfaction.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>With no sound.</p>
        <p>No bang.</p>
        <p>No outro.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Just like a wind has swept.</p>
        <p>How an eagle kills a sparrow.</p>
        <p>No sound.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I lay on the ground.</p>
        <p>Unseen by none.</p>
        <p>But my creator.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>My guitar lays on my side.</p>
        <p>Just like on the birth.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Wind blows.</p>
        <p>Clouds emerges.</p>
        <p>Rain starts to pour.</p>
        <p>Thunders.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The animals look above for a minute.</p>
        <p>The thunder rumbles.</p>
        <p>Like it did when I came.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I shall go.</p>
        <p>Unseen by none.</p>
        <p>Known by many.</p>
        <p>Praised by few.</p>
        <p>Loved by none.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>May I find salvation.</p>

      <div class="poem-body">
        <p>It's not in Temple I find him;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It's in the darkest of sky night,</p>
        <p>With the brightness of moon,</p>
        <p>Wirh the loudest of thunder,</p>
        <p>With heaviest of rain.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In the thunder I hear him,</p>
        <p>In the sky I see him,</p>
        <p>In the air I feel him,</p>
        <p>As if he's right there in the sky,</p>
        <p>Gretting me with open arms,</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The chills running down my spine is his hug,</p>
        <p>Cold yet inviting,</p>
        <p>I don't want to go in warmth,</p>
        <p>This IS my warmth,</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Behind me is his shadow,</p>
        <p>Yet he stands in front,</p>
        <p>So huge can't even fathom his size or shape,</p>
        <p>Yet so small he fits in my heart,</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I am here,</p>
        <p>I am with him,</p>
        <p>He is me,</p>
        <p>I am him.</p>
